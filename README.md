## PyTreeMap ##

This is a python toolkit for drawing **treemaps**. A treemap is a type of tree diagram that allows nodes to be compared according to some relative measure, in addition visualizing the heirarchical structure of the data.

Below is an example of a two-level tree drawn as a tree-map.

This library relies on techniques and code from [this matlab package](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/17192-treemap) by [Joel Hicklin](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/authors/3233) from The MathWorks.
